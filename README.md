# ofxYolo2
People who run on osx or linux please use
https://github.com/mrzl/ofxDarknet/

I created this because I have some problems running ofxDarknet on windows.
This version uses a windows darknet port from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Usage:
Download the yolo-voc.weights (http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo-voc.weights) file to your data folder.
Also copy the yolo_cpp_dll.dll from the dll to your bin folder (will make a build rule for that in the future)
Last but not least CUDA 8.0 for Windows x64: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Currently works only in X64 releasemode
