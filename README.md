# ofxYolo2
openFrameworks integration for the yolo.dll from the Darknet windows version.

Usage:
Download the yolo-voc.weights (http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo-voc.weights) file to your data folder.
Also copy the yolo_cpp_dll.dll from the dll to your bin folder (will make a build rule for that in the future)
Not sure if you need cuda installed as well to run the demo.

Currently works only in X64 releasemode
